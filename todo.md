# TODO

- Add tests
- What if keys have dots in them? Add escaping of dots somehow?
- Could we allow indexing a list with integers?

- Add recursive update, concatenate, etc. for trees of dicts/objects
- Allow setting custom object instead of dict? Would require some thinking but could be done
- Make nested_delattr
- For getattr -> allow different default for leaf
- nested_update
- wildcard (*) or regex in path leading to bulk op
